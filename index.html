                <h1>Hi, I'm Agatha <span class="wave">👋</span></h1>
                <p >💡<i> “Knowledge grows when shared, and opportunities grow when we connect.”</i> <br>I am a<b> B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Amal Jyothi College of Engineering (Autonomous)</b> with a strong passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. Deeply interested in AI, ML, and Data Analytics, I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems can transform everyday challenges into meaningful solutions. I am genuinely passionate about coding, and I love the process of creating, experimenting, and building something new from scratch—whether it’s a small script, a UI concept, or a full-fledged project.<br>
I have hands-on experience in <b>Python, ANSI C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Linux, DSA, Prompt Engineering, and UI/UX design using Figma</b>. I am currently pursuing an internship at <b>NeST Digital Solution Technologies Ltd, Ernakulam</b>, where I work in Frontend Development using the Angular framework. This experience has strengthened my understanding of modern web development, component-driven architecture, clean UI practices, and collaborative project workflows—helping me grow as both a developer and a problem-solver. Also during my internship at <b>INCIAL as a Video Presenter</b>, I strengthened my communication and presentation skills, which helped me express technical ideas clearly and confidently. One of my proudest achievements is securing the 9th position in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, where our idea was recognized among the top leading solutions.<br>
Beyond academics, I’m someone who draws inspiration from creativity—through singing, drawing, and writing—which fuels my ability to think differently and approach coding with imagination and clarity. I enjoy working on projects, learning new tools, and pushing myself to understand technology at a deeper level. I’m always excited to collaborate, brainstorm, and grow with people who share a passion for innovation. I am open to internships, collaborations, and opportunities in the IT and Consulting domains, continuously seeking environments where I can learn, contribute, and evolve both personally and professionally.</p>
